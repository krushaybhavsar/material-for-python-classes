# How to Use the Material
#### Suggested Textbook: ![Python for Everybody by Dr. Charles R. Severance]()
The way I began teaching was by first starting with the basics of each lesson from the textbook. After the student felt confident in a specific lesson, I gave them several practice exercises. Of the ones linked in the repository, I believe the calculators were the simplest to start with (and maybe some puzzles from the puzzles.py file). The textbook also has its own practice problems so I used that sometimes as well. In my opinion, the best way to learn a programming language is to just keep practicing and building off of what you already know. That's why it's important to spend more time on letting the students practice writing their own programs than actually teaching the lesson. Another key thing about learning CS (especially if it's the student's first time) is teaching them to troubleshoot on their own. I noticed that for me personally, I spend more time fixing bugs in my code than actually writing it (idk could just be me being a bad programmer).

This is the order in which I assigned the material to my past students:<br/>
<i>Note: puzzles.py was used throughout the course as a way to challenge the students between lessons.</i>
<ol>
  <li>Simple4Op.py - if statements, type conversion</li>
  <li>DecimalToFractionCalc.py - for loops, builds on if statements</li>
  <li>Hangman.py - while loops, lists, and builds on everything learned earlier</li>
  <li>OOP.py - object oriented programming, builds on functions, teeny bit about decorators</li>
  <li>FlappyBirdPygame - introduction to pygame and applications of programming</li>
  <li>PongPygame - builds on pygame and introduces automation</li>
  <li>PacmanPygame - advanced usage of previous topics with a very slight exposure to algorithms</li>
</ol>
<p>I have not gotten into data structures in python with my students yet but that is something I plan on going over in the future.</p>
